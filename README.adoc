= Fabric8 Common

A repository containing all common packages used by the fabric8 services.

== Importing packages from other `fabric8-services` projects

Warning: be sure to work on a topic branch before running the command below!

The `Makefile` includes a goal to export the commits for a given package (or a single file) from any other `fabric8-services` project into a patch file which can then be applied to the `fabric8-common` repository, which allows for importing the commit history along with the source code.

The syntax to use is: `make import project=<project> pkg<pkg>`. 
For example: 
----
make import project=fabric8-wit pkg=convert

make import project=fabric8-wit pkg=design/api.go
----

Once the patch has been applied, the `dep ensure -v` and `go build ./...` commands will be executed, in order to verify that everything compiles :)
