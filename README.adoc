= Fabric8 Common

a repository containing all common packages used by the fabric8 services.

== Importing packages from other `fabric8-services` projects

Warning: be sure to work on a topic branch before running the command below!

The `Makefile` proposes a goal to export the commits for a given package of another `fabric8-services` project into a patch file which can then be applied to the `fabric8-common` repository.

The syntax to use is: `make import project=<project> pkg<pkg>`. For example: `make import project=fabric8-wit pkg=convert`

Once the patch has been applied, the `dep ensure -v` and `go build ./...` commands will be executed, in order to verify that everything is fine :)
